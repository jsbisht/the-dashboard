# 10–10–10: A Life-Transforming Idea
Suzy Welch introduces a simple decision-making system. When you have a decision to make, ask yourself the following three questions:

How will I feel about this decision 10 minutes from now?
How will I feel about it 10 months from now?
And in 10 years from now?

# Track Your Time
Most of us can guess, but our estimates are normally way off. A time-tracking app can help you take out the guesswork and provide real data on your productivity.

## 2-Minute Rule
If it can be done in two minutes, just do it.
> Don’t add it to your to-do list, put it aside for later, or delegate to someone else. Just do it.
