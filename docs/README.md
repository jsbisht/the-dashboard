# Problem Statement

How to manange, where to spend the limited time available to me.

## Description

I would like to and have to pursue multiple activities in life. I would like to use a tool to help me manage these interests.

I would like to manage:

* I would like to spend time on multiple skills
* I would like to gain more knowledge
* I would like to keep myself upbeat with latest stuff
* I would like to manage my todo items
* I would like to make notes about things
* I would like to manage my finance

There are too many distractions in life, that makes us forget the things that matter us more. (HOW DO YOU SPECIFY WHICH ACTIVITY MATTERS TO YOU MORE)

# Expectations

* For a given calendar item, be able to add subitems:

   * Notes
   * Videos
   * Bookmarks
   * Attachments
   * (Custom Add Ons)
* Be able to add calendar item, without knowing time slot for it.
* Be able to mark activities and tasks.
* Emphasis on activity size based on CRIETERIA:
   * Time allocated
   * Number of times a calendar item is missed
* Archive activities / Resume activities
* Based on activities show me list of actions to be taken by me each day.
* For todo items:
   * I would want to be reminded early before i start an activity, or for some I would want to reminded just at the set the time.
